## About me

I’m Olivia (Yijing), a Communication Science Research Master’s student @ University of Amsterdam
With an undergrad in Advertising from Fudan University and two years of Economics training,  
I thrive in exploring the intersection of data storytelling, computational methods, and digital media.  

## Featured Projects
### [AH for All: A/B Test on Inclusive Email Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tK2ACZEiPk9baz4nWBW1Iv90gidyRI_m/view?usp=sharing)  
A simulation-based A/B testing project for Albert Heijn, the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands, assessing whether adding an English-language button to Dutch discount emails improves engagement and purchase behavior among expats. Analysis conducted with **Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, SHAP)**, including logistic regression, OLS, decision trees, and explainable AI audits. The results informed data-driven UX suggestions and stakeholder-oriented reporting. Submitted for the course *Digital Analytics* at the University of Amsterdam.

 ### [Aesthetics & Sentiment in Social Media Posts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18p9a1jnp-mF5Rn_5GMD-Z3FPEm3w2TaY/view?usp=sharing)
A linguistic and sentiment analysis project exploring the relationship between emotional tone and aesthetic quality in social media content. Using a real-world dataset of 700+ posts, I operationalized aesthetic level via figurative language, rhythm, and imagery (scored by LLaMA3.2 via Ollama), and sentiment type via VADER. The pipeline involved data minimization, emoji demojization, sentiment scoring, LLM-based aesthetic classification, and visualization using **Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, NLTK, Ollama)**. Submitted for the course *Digital Analytics* at the University of Amsterdam.

### [Parental Mood & Child Expenditure Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AjkNU0hDm5sp6Jn5zu7n-ilpKnMsl9Fc/view?usp=sharing)
An exploratory data visualization project investigating how parental moods (e.g., stress, calm) influence spending patterns on children. Conducted using **R (tidyverse, ggplot2, tidyr, reshape2) and longitudinal survey data**, the project features custom heatmaps, bubble plots, and significance testing across mood–expenditure dimensions. Submitted for the course *Using R for Data Wrangling, Analysis & Visualization* at the University of Amsterdam.
