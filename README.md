## About me

I’m Yijing (Olivia), a Communication Science Research Master’s student @ University of Amsterdam (UvA) 🇳🇱  
With an undergrad in Advertising from Fudan University and two years of Economics training,  
I’m now exploring the intersection of data storytelling, computational methods, and digital media.  
Curious, warm, pragmatic, and laser-focused when it matters.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: learning Dutch (A2 → B1) — 400+ day streak on Duolingo.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: SQL & Power BI, while sharpening my Python & R for advanced data analysis.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: creative data projects that combine media, tech, and storytelling.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: building a portfolio that’s as visually stunning as it is technically solid.
- 💬 Ask me about: Tang and Song dynasty poetry, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, protein-packed cooking.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects
### 🛍️ [AH for All: A/B Test on Inclusive Email Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tK2ACZEiPk9baz4nWBW1Iv90gidyRI_m/view?usp=sharing)  
A simulation-based A/B testing project for Albert Heijn, the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands, assessing whether adding an English-language button to Dutch discount emails improves engagement and purchase behavior among expats. Analysis conducted with **Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, SHAP)**, including logistic regression, OLS, decision trees, and explainable AI audits. The results informed data-driven UX suggestions and stakeholder-oriented reporting. Submitted for the course *Digital Analytics* at the University of Amsterdam.

 ### ✨ [Aesthetics & Sentiment in Social Media Posts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18p9a1jnp-mF5Rn_5GMD-Z3FPEm3w2TaY/view?usp=sharing)
A linguistic and sentiment analysis project exploring the relationship between emotional tone and aesthetic quality in social media content. Using a real-world dataset of 700+ posts, I operationalized aesthetic level via figurative language, rhythm, and imagery (scored by LLaMA3.2 via Ollama), and sentiment type via VADER. The pipeline involved data minimization, emoji demojization, sentiment scoring, LLM-based aesthetic classification, and visualization using **Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, NLTK, Ollama)**. Submitted for the course *Digital Analytics* at the University of Amsterdam.

### 📊 [Parental Mood & Child Expenditure Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AjkNU0hDm5sp6Jn5zu7n-ilpKnMsl9Fc/view?usp=sharing)
An exploratory data visualization project investigating how parental moods (e.g., stress, calm) influence spending patterns on children. Conducted using **R (tidyverse, ggplot2, tidyr, reshape2) and longitudinal survey data**, the project features custom heatmaps, bubble plots, and significance testing across mood–expenditure dimensions. Submitted for the course *Using R for Data Wrangling, Analysis & Visualization* at the University of Amsterdam.
